# Python Network Programming 2025

A weekly lab-based journey from classical sockets to future networks. Building one network agreement in Python every week—simple first, then fragile, then strange.

## Course Philosophy

Networks are not cables and boxes. **They are agreements under uncertainty.** You already know IP addressing and routing. Now we program behavior.

## Learning Path Overview

| Week | Topic | Type | Core Concepts |
|------|-------|------|---|
| 1 | Client–Server Communication (TCP Unicast) | BASIC | TCP sockets, bind, listen, accept, connect, request–response |
| 2 | UDP Communication (Connectionless Unicast) | BASIC | UDP sockets, datagrams, packet loss, no guarantees |
| 3 | Broadcast Communication | BASIC | LAN broadcast scope, discovery, service advertisement |
| 4 | Multicast Communication | BASIC | Group membership, multicast groups, selective delivery |
| 5 | Peer-to-Peer Networking | BASIC | Symmetric roles, dynamic ports, no central server |
| 6 | Ad-Hoc Networking (MANET Simulation) | BASIC | Neighbor discovery, routing, TTL, improvised networks |
| 7 | Store-and-Forward Communication | BASIC | Message queues, retry logic, persistent buffers |
| 8 | Opportunistic Routing | BASIC | Probability-based forwarding, encounter routing |
| 9 | Bio-Inspired Networking | ADVANCED | Pheromone routing, reinforcement learning, adaptive paths |
| 10 | Quantum-Inspired Networking | ADVANCED | No-cloning, one-time tokens, quantum-secure concepts |

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to any `week*` directory
2. Configure your environment in `config.py`
3. Run server/sender in one terminal
4. Run client/receiver in another terminal
5. Observe the network behavior

Example (Week 1):
```bash
python server.py
python client.py
```

## Philosophy Note

> If your program never fails, it's lying.

Networks are inherently uncertain. This curriculum teaches you to build programs that acknowledge failure, handle it, and communicate despite it.
